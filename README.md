# Iris Flower Dataset Analysis & Prediction

<p>
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. This classic dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as logistic regression, decision tree random forest, k-nearest neighbors and also support vector machines.
